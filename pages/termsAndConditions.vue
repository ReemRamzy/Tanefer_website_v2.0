We are not liable for any claim for loss, damage, injury, death, misrepresentation, delay, inconvenience or disappointment, arising from any action by a Supplier, including but not limited to any negligent or willful act or failure to act of any Supplier or of any other third party. We will not be liable to you for any claim unless the occurrence was due to our own gross negligence or willful fault. You agree that in no event shall we be liable in any claim for other than compensatory damages, including but not limited to any indirect, consequential, punitive special or exemplary, or incidental damages, however caused, and whether sought in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, and regardless of whether we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Operator’s liability for compensatory damages hereunder shall in no event exceed the amount actually paid by you to Operator for the trip giving rise to the claim. The foregoing limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      b) In connection with your cruise, Company shall not be liable for any tours, activities, products or services, other than aboard Company's vessels and tenders, provided in connection with, before, after or during your cruise, including but not limited to pre and post cruise activities, shore excursions, hotel accommodations, meals, or transportation of any kind by any vessel, aircraft, or other conveyance, including, but not limited to, air travel to and from the vessel which are provided, owned and/or operated by independent contractors whose employees, facilities, conveyances, products and services are not subject to Company's supervision or control.

    <p>
      We provide tours to a large number of touristic destinations around Egypt. You agree to assume responsibility for your own health and safety, and we cannot guarantee your safety at any time. Local conditions, including infrastructure, road conditions, medical care, safety and security, may differ significantly from those found in the United States; beaches may have strong currents, riptides, or high waves and be without warning signs or lifeguards. At any given moment there are also likely to be “trouble spots” in the world in terms of war, terrorism, crime, Acts of God, civil commotions, labor trouble, and/or other potential sources of harm. The United States Department of State, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other governmental and tourist organizations provide information on foreign countries, including details of local conditions in specified cities and countries according to such agency's perception of risks to travelers. We strongly recommend you obtain and consider such information when making travel decisions. We assume no responsibility for gathering such information or providing it to you.
    </p>

    <h3>5 - MEDICAL CARE; TRAVEL PROTECTION</h3>
    <p>
      You recognize and agree that we are not in the business of providing medical services and/or operating medical facilities. You acknowledge that the medical benefits provided under the travel protection plan (if purchased) are provided and administered by non-affiliated third parties, whose identities are listed under the travel protection plan documents. You therefore agree that we are not responsible for the provision of, or adequacy of, any medical care provided including but not limited to any medical care provided under the travel insurance / protection plan.

      During your tour, the availability of medical care may be limited or delayed. You acknowledge that all or part of your tour or voyage may be in areas where medical care and evacuation may not be available. You agree to indemnify and reimburse Company in the event Company elects to advance the cost of emergency medical care, including medical care provided ashore as well as transportation and/or lodging in connection therewith.

      For your benefit, we strongly recommend that you purchase travel insurance / protection to protect against loss or damage to baggage and personal effects, trip cancellation and interruption, emergency evacuation, accidental death or injury, illness and medical expenses sustained or incurred in connection with your cruise and/or tour.

All passports must contain at least five blank pages and must be valid for six months after the completion of your trip or cruise. Non-U.S. citizens should contact the appropriate consular office for entry requirements pertaining to their trip, as we are not responsible for providing you with this information or documentation (visit our website).

You may be refused boarding or disembarked from aircraft  without liability for refund, payment, compensation, or credit of any kind if you do not have proper documentation, and you will be subject to any fine or other costs incurred by Company which result from improper documentation or noncompliance with applicable regulations.
    </p>

    <h3>13 - AIR ARRANGEMENTS</h3>
    <p>
      a) General: For your convenience, Operator offers four choices for your air travel arrangements: Land Only, Standard Air, Contract Air and Published Air as described below. All options may not be available for all trips. If you make your own domestic or international flight arrangements in connection with any of these options, Operator and its affiliates will not be responsible for any loss resulting from cancellations or changes in air itineraries including without limitation changes in international gateways or travel dates or times. For all air travel arrangements made by Operator, you will receive a final package approximately fifteen days prior to your departure date that will include your airline tickets. Please note that your airline tickets and other trip documentation must bear your first and last names exactly as they appear on your passport. It is your responsibility to check your travel documents when you receive them to make sure they are correct. If they are not correct, please contact Operator immediately. Operator and its affiliates are not responsible if an airline cancels or delays a flight for any reason (including weather). If you are unable to make your departure, it is your responsibility to work with the airline on which you are ticketed to reach your destination. Operator and its affiliates are not responsible for any additional expenses you may incur prior to joining your trip. Operator and its affiliates are not responsible for and will not provide any refund for portions of trips missed due to cancelled or delayed flights. If an air schedule requires an overnight stay in a gateway city, the costs of the overnight stay (including hotel and meals) are at your expense. Air routings are subject to availability. Routings are not guaranteed, and are subject to change at any time. If you change your return reservation after departure for the trip, you may be charged a higher airfare or a penalty by the airline. If your new return reservation is made directly with the airline, it is your responsibility to pay any such additional airfare and/or penalty directly to the airline. If your new return reservation is made through Operator, then it is your responsibility to pay any such additional airfare and/or penalty to Operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      b) Land Tours Only: If you purchase the Land Tours Only package, you will be responsible for making all domestic and international air travel. We recommend that you do not purchase tickets with high penalty charges for changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      c) Standard Air: With this option, we will make the reservations for the U.S. domestic and/or international air arrangements that are included in your trip. We reserve the right to choose the air carrier routing, and city airport from each departure city. Unless you pay an additional fee, all travel will be reserved for economy class on regularly scheduled airlines. Business class upgrades may be available for an additional fee; any such upgrades may apply to your outbound and inbound international flights only and may not be valid on domestic or regional flights. Scheduling may differ for Business Class travel compared to non-Business Class travel. Whenever possible, we arrange your flight schedule so that you have at least one hour between connecting domestic flights and international flights. In some cases, your connecting time could be two hours or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      d) Changes to your departure city, pre- and post-trip extensions, tour date, or destination up to 45 days prior to departure will not incur any penalty fee if you have chosen Standard Air. All other reservation changes or cancellations in connection with Standard Air are subject to the Reservation Changes terms of Section 9 and Cancellation and Refunds terms of Section 8.
    </p>
    <p>
      e) Contract Air: With this option, you may choose your air carrier and routing from a pre-determined list of flights, as may be available based on the contracts we hold with various airlines. This option is available beginning 24-48 hours after your initial deposit has been received, and all requests must be received by no later than 71 days prior to your departure. Just contact our Air Travel Counselors with your request. Confirmed Contract Air requests are subject to potential incremental costs as compared to Standard Air. All flights are subject to availability at the time of the request. Changes to your departure city, pre- and post-trip extensions, tour date, or destination up to 90 days prior to departure for a Land Tour and up to 120 days prior to departure for a Small Ship or River Cruise will not incur any penalty fee if you have chosen Contract Air. However, you will need to re-request Contract Air if you wish to use Contract Air on your changed reservation and will incur new potential incremental costs as compared to your original Contract Air request. All other reservation changes or cancellations are subject to the Reservation Changes terms of Section 9 and Cancellation and Refunds terms of Section 8.

      f) Published Air: With this option, you have the greatest flexibility in selecting your air travel. You may select the air carrier of your choice and any available routing, using the published airfare as determined by the airline. This option is available 24-48 hours after your initial deposit has been received, and all requests must be received no later than 71 days prior to your departure. Confirmed Published Air requests are subject fees as determined by the airline in addition to the published airfare. Both the fees and the published airfare payments are due once the request has been confirmed. All flights are subject to availability at the time of the request. Published Air tickets are issued upon receipt of payment. All sales are final and the ticket fare is nonrefundable by us; we act only as a travel agent in purchasing the Published Air ticket as a convenience to you. The Reservation Changes terms of Section 9 and the Cancellation and Refunds terms of Section 8 do not apply to the costs of Published Air tickets. Any changes to or cancellations of Published Air tickets are subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the issuing airline.

      g) Frequent Flier Programs. Frequent flier programs are operated solely by the airlines. Our group rates provide you with the best value but the airline may impose restrictions related to earning miles and in some cases even prohibit mileage accrual. We are not responsible for any mileage accrual you fail to earn by traveling with us.

      h) Breakaway: On certain Operator vacations, you have the option to enjoy breakaway travel prior to or at the end of your trip. This option enables you to travel on your own. Operator does not assist in making travel or air arrangements for breakaway travel; you must make these arrangements yourself. You must arrange to return to your departure airport for your flight home. Additional air charges with respect to your travel arranged by Operator or its affiliates may apply. All requests must be received no later than 46 days prior to your departure. You will be responsible for confirming your international flight back to the U.S. and for your own transfers to the airport. Consult our Travel Counselors for details. Please note: The Company is not responsible for any liability for any activity or trip you take independently while on this program. This includes without limitation liability for any changes made by an airline that affect your air arrangements for a period of time when you are traveling independently of your group, whether we handled the air ticketing or not.

    <h3>14 - MEDICAL ISSUES AND SPECIAL NEEDS</h3>
    <p>
      a) You are encouraged to report any disability requiring special attention to us at the time the reservation is made, including requiring the use of special equipment. We will make reasonable efforts to accommodate the special needs of tour and cruise participants. Such participants, however, should be aware that the Americans with Disabilities Act is inapplicable outside of the United States and facilities outside the United States for disabled individuals are limited.

      b) Most of our trips are not wheelchair or motorized scooter accessible, as wheelchair or motorized scooter assistance or accessibility in international destinations cannot be guaranteed. If your trip is wheelchair-accessible and you require a wheelchair, you must provide your own small, collapsible wheelchair. On most international trips, we cannot accommodate women past their sixth month of pregnancy and cannot accommodate service animals.
    </p>

      c) If you are unable to travel without assistance, you must be accompanied by an able companion. It is strongly recommended that persons requiring assistance be accompanied by a companion who is capable of and is completely responsible for providing the assistance. Neither Company nor its personnel, nor its suppliers, may physically lift or assist passengers into transportation vehicles. If a traveler thinks he or she might need assistance during a trip, he or she should call us to determine what assistance might reasonably be given. The Company cannot provide special individual assistance to passengers with special needs for walking, dining or other routine activities or personal services.

      d) If you have a condition that requires special equipment or treatment, you must bring and be responsible for all necessary items related to your condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      e) If you have a condition as contemplated herein, you travel at your own risk. Operator is not liable for any injuries or damages you may suffer relating to such a condition, including without limitation loss of special equipment, lack of assistance with or accommodation of special needs, and unavailability of medical assistance or treatment.
